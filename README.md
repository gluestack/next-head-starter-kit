This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) + [Gluestack-ui](https://ui.gluestack.io/) project template bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`@gluestack-ui`](https://ui.gluestack.io/docs/overview/introduction) library that provides optionally styled and accessible components. These components are designed for easy integration into applications developed with React and React Native.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
